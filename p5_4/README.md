My program: 

My program consists of a face which is trapped inside of a circle made of Social media logos. 
The concept is that the user ofthe program needs to get the man out of the circle without toughing the logos by
using the keys: arrow up, arrow down, arrow left and arrow right.
If the face touches the logos the face will return to the centre of the circle. 

In my program I have used images, basic shapes to make
the face, the KeyPressed function and a if-function to make the face react to
the touch of a logo. I chose to use the KeyPessed function because I thought it
would be the easiest function to work with. It turned out to be a lot more
challenging than I had expected because there were a lot of shapes and images that
needed to work together. Luckily for me the instructors helped me in the
process and were very good a explaining how the cods should be used and how
they work together. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about data, how we
capture data and how data is related to the users of digital artifacts. In
today’s society social media collects on a daily basis a lot of data from all
around the world and there are millions of users who share unlimited amounts of
information. I believe that social media can become an addiction to a lot of
users and therefore it can be very difficult to leave social media. being
offline or disconnected can give the user a feeling of missing out and not
knowing what is happening in the world. My program is therefore a symbol of a user
who is trying to leave social media but can’t because it has become an addiction.
